## Projects


### Ontologies

__[Comorbid-graphs](https://github.com/DorenCalliku/comorbid-graphs)__

How to define comorbidity of mental-health diseases? With the several types of classification systems (DSM-V, HiTOP, RDoC) the task is not as straightforward, so a shared dictionary needs to be set. Through comorbid-graphs, a simple nlp process based on open-ontologies is applied on texts of clinical relevance. It is a proof of concept for possible further integration.

__[Garden-of-Graphs](http://garden-of-graphs.herokuapp.com/)__

A website for `comorbid-graphs` that allows interaction with the graphs produced from the nlp pipeline. It contains analysis on DSM-V and psychology therapies. It is there to provide a visual on the depths of the topics.

### Psychology

__[Psychopy-DirectorTask](https://github.com/DorenCalliku/directortask)__

Implementation of the task by Dumontheil et al. (2010), targeting Theory of Mind for the young and elderly.
Updates on previous setup is the functionality of drag-n-drop which makes the experience smooth for the elderly.
